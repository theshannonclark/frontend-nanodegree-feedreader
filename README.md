# Project: Feed Reader Testing - Shannon Clark

This is a project developed as part of Udacity's [Front-end developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The aim of this project is to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started
First you'll need to download the project by cloning the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/theshannonclark/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git feedreader
```

Then change into the project directory with `cd feedreader`.

Finally open `index.html` in your web browser. At the bottom of the page is a section that shows which tests have passed.
